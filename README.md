# Node POC Prototype

## Overview

The following prototype will allow us to quickly bootstrap Node projects in the future, this allows us to ensure consistency across our Node repositories.

### ESlint and Prettier

We use ESlint as both a formatter and code quality assurance, while using Prettier to apply formatting on save.

#### To setup format on save, do the following

1. Install the [Prettier VScode extenstion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

2. Open your user settings inside VScode and search for: format

3. Select your Default Formatter as: `Prettier - Code formatter`.

4. Click the checkbox under: `Format on Save`.

5. Reload VScode.
